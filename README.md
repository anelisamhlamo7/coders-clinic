 Coders Clinic
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Coders Clinic is a platform where senior students volunteer to help junior students with coding problems or assist them in understanding programming concepts.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

_Senior Students (Volunteers)_:
1. Access Coders Clinic Calendar: Senior students can view and insert available days, times, and campus locations where they are available to volunteer.
2. Add Multiple Slots: Volunteers can create as many available slots as they like.
3. Receive Booking Updates: Once a student books a slot, the volunteer’s Google Calendar is updated with the booking details, showing which student has booked the slot.


_Junior Students_:
1. View Available Slots: Students can browse available volunteer slots to book time for help.
2. Describe Problem: When booking, students can describe the type of problem they need help with, allowing the volunteer to prepare ahead of time.
3. Get Calendar Updates: Upon successful booking, the student’s Google Calendar is updated with the confirmed booking.


_Booking Process_:
- Volunteer Calendar: Once a booking is confirmed, the volunteer’s calendar is updated to indicate that a student has booked the slot.
- Accept Invitations: Volunteers will receive a Google Calendar invitation that they need to accept. On the day of the session, or earlier if preferred, the volunteer and student can meet and work on the problem

_Cancellations_:
- Volunteers: Volunteers can cancel their available slots if needed.
- Students: Students can cancel their bookings, but this must be done at least 12 hours before the scheduled session.
